# wzpr

react-native app boilerplate / starter
fonts and other manually linked stuff -> rename with react-native-rename

goals; 

moving the mapbox application from react 0.60 
upgrade react-navigation v4 -> v5 react-navigation 
decoupled authentication, add expressjs OAuth provider for test (heroku)
try out new form frameworks / themes

overall must prefer; 

functions instead of classes (where new)
test context is tolerable over Redux
test websockets api
